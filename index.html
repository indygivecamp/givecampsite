              <p>
                Hearts &amp; Hands of Indiana has a simple mission: help families and individuals attain affordable, long-term
                home ownership on the Near Westside of Indianapolis by providing education, mentoring, and quality
                rehabilitated homes. They are growing that mission, going from one new house to four this coming year!
                They have a decent website and great stories to tell, but they have no simple way to make changes to the site. That's where we come in.

              <h3>Business and Professional Exchange</h3>
              <p>
                Business &amp; Professional Exchange holds weekly meetings specifically for professionals in career transition.
                Members learn and practice the skills needed to find jobs in an ever-changing employment environment. They've
                grown to six chapters across the state based on the quality of their organization but feel limited in their
                reach without a professional-looking website.

              <h3>Pathway to Recovery</h3>
              <p>
                The mission of Pathway to Recovery is to provide housing with wrap around services to homeless adults with
                co-existing disorders such as mental illness, substance abuse, and other barriers that prevent them from
                accessing and sustaining mainstream housing opportunities. Pathway helps participants end their cycle of
                homelessness by becoming mentally and physically stable, financially self-sufficient, and begin healthy
                independent living following placement in safe affordable substance-free permanent housing. They recently
                had a volunteer convert their site to a cms. This is great, but they could use help in learning how to use it!
